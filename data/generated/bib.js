        "abstract": "Recent advances in vehicular communication technologies, including DSRC, LTE, enable cars to observe the surroundings, communicate (between each other, roadside units, and pedestrians), and analyze various potential hazards more effectively. However, for now, such communication is largely limited to broadcasting alerts. We believe it is mostly because of the mismatch between the current standards of the networking architecture (IP) and vehicular application semantics. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Named Data Networking (NDN)-a promising information-centric networking architecture-over CV2X to build a scalable pedestrian-awareness application, SPA, where we have primarily focused on vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication. NDN is designed to network by names and secured data items instead of point-to-point packet delivery and is especially beneficial for vehicular applications. This paper proposes a specific design of a scalable pedestrian-awareness application, SPA, that leverages the data-centric communication model of NDN, addressing scalability and network communication efficiency, without compromising (qualitative) information dissemination. To confirm the findings, the paper presents a simulation-based study, comparing bandwidth use and comparing it with a currently proposed pedestrian safety application.",

In this paper, we design a system that enables vehicles in a VANET to search for mobile cloud servers that are moving nearby and discover their services and resources. The system depends on RSUs that act as cloud directories with which mobile cloud servers register. The RSUs share their registration data to enable vehicles to discover and consume the services of mobile cloud servers within a certain area. We evaluated the proposed system using the ns2 software and demonstrated through comparing the results to another mechanism the feasibility and efficiency of our system in terms of service discovery and service consuming delays and packet success ratio.",

The performance of transportation systems is of crucial importance for individual mobility, commerce, and for the economic growth of all nations. In recent years modern society has been facing more traffic jams, higher fuel prices, and an increase in CO2 emissions. It is imperative to improve the safety and efficiency of transportation. Developing a sustainable intelligent transportation system requires the seamless integration and interoperability with emerging technologies such as connected vehicles, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. In this article we present and discuss some of the integration challenges that must be addressed to enable an intelligent transportation system to address issues facing the transportation sector such as high fuel prices, high levels of CO2 emissions, increasing traffic congestion, and improved road safety.",

However, as the number of connected vehicles keeps increasing, new requirements (such as seamless, secure, robust, scalable information exchange among vehicles, humans, and roadside infrastructures) of vehicular networks are emerging. In this context, the original concept of vehicular ad-hoc networks is being transformed into a new concept called the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). We discuss the benefits of IoV along with recent industry standards developed to promote its implementation. We further present recently proposed communication protocols to enable the seamless integration and operation of the IoV. Finally, we present future research directions of IoV that require further consideration from the vehicular research community.",

However, vehicle obstructions along the road environments introduce shadowing effect. Consequently, system performance in receiver side are reduced in terms of received signal strength. As a result, the reduction of received power caused the effect to PER and other performance parameters. Then, this paper introduces the study of path loss and shadowing effect with 5GNR communication technology. Performance parameters are investigated in different environments.",

        "abstract": "Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (CV2X) has recently piqued the interest of both industry and academia. CV2X extends communication coverage by using the cellular infrastructure as a standard for vehicular communication. CV2X also enables the communication between vehicles and pedestrians, vehicles and the cellular network, along with vehicle to vehicle communication. The CV2X standard\u2019s expectations are gradually rising as the number of vehicles, cell phone users, smart devices connected to vehicles, and other factors increase. A more efficient CV2X framework is needed to fulfill these expectations. We focused on the PHY layer of the CV2X standard and proposed a model featuring Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed model is able to improve reliability by reducing the bit error rate compared to the existing PHY layer framework. In addition, our proposed model can increase the throughput up to 1.4 times and 2 times at 10 MHz and 20 MHz channels, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication has recently gained attention in industry and academia. Different implementation scenarios have been derived by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5th Generation (5G) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standard, Release 16. Quality of service (QoS) is important to achieve reliable communication and parameters which have to be considered are reliability, end-to-end latency, data rate, communication range, throughput and vehicle density for an urban area. However, it would be desirable to design a dynamic selecting system (with emphasis on channel coding parameters selection) so that all QoS parameters are satisfied. Having this idea in mind, in this work we examine nine V2X implementation scenarios using Long Term Evolution (LTE) turbo coding with a geometry&minus;based efficient propagation model for vehicle-to-vehicle communication (GEMV), where we consider the above QoS parameters for SOVA, log-MAP and max-log-MAP decoding algorithms. Our study is suitable for 3GPP cooperative sensing, for the eight scenarios considering medium and large signal-noise-ratio (SNR) values. The proposed model is sustainable despite a doubled data rate, which results in a minimal bit error rate (BER) performance loss up to 1.85 dB. In this case tripling the data rate results in a further 1 dB loss. Moreover, a small loss up to 0.4 dB is seen for a vehicle speed increase from 60 km/h to 100 km/h. Finally, increasing vehicle density has no effect on the implemented 3GPP scenario considering end-to-end latency, irrespectively from the decoding algorithm.",
